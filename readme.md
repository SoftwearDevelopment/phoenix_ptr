# phoenix_ptr

A thread safe, header-only implementation of a  smart
pointer that deletes the contained object when not needed at
the moment and recreates the object when needed again.

This is useful when resources are very rarely needed, when
a resource is easy to create and delete, but difficult to
maintain or when you want to defer the initialisation of
a global variable to when it's actually needed.

I wrote this for an application that had two modes (1)
didn't need a database connection (2) had to share
a database connection between multiple threads.
Using phoenix_ptr I could declare the connection in the
containing namespace; in (1) the connection would stay
unallocated, in (2) the first thread would open the
connection and all other threads would reuse it too.

```c++
#include "softwear/phoenix_ptr.hpp"
softwear::phoenix_ptr<my_class> my_phoenix_instance;
```

## Example

See tests.cc for an example.

## Documentation

include/softwear/phoenix_ptr.hpp contains detailed
documentation.

## Testing

Run `make`.

## TODO

* Allow using different types for mutex/lock_guard/weak_ptr/shared_ptr (e.g. the boost ones)
* Allow using an allocator
* Allow using creator/deleter functions
* Allow forwarding parameters
* Allow using some timeout?
